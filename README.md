# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Purpose

I started with very limited knowledge of coding.  This study guide is intended to help me learn and remember what I have learned through the upcoming coding bootcamp.  Creating the website taught me skills in HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. Every aspect of the site itself helps me remember these skills in addition to the lists themselves.
